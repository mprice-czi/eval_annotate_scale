    "excerpt": "When the young people returned to the ballroom, it presented a decidedly changed appearance. Instead of an interior scene, it was a winter landscape.\nThe floor was covered with snow-white canvas, not laid on smoothly, but rumpled over bumps and hillocks, like a real snow field. The numerous palms and evergreens that had decorated the room, were powdered with flour and strewn with tufts of cotton, like snow. Also diamond dust had been lightly sprinkled on them, and glittering crystal icicles hung from the branches.\nAt each end of the room, on the wall, hung a beautiful bear-skin rug.\nThese rugs were for prizes, one for the girls and one for the boys. And this was the game.\nThe girls were gathered at one end of the room and the boys at the other, and one end was called the North Pole, and the other the South Pole. Each player was given a small flag which they were to plant on reaching the Pole.\nThis would have been an easy matter, but each traveller was obliged to wear snowshoes.",

    "excerpt": "All through dinner time, Mrs. Fayre was somewhat silent, her eyes resting on Dolly with a wistful, uncertain expression. She wanted to give the child the pleasure she craved, but she had hard work to bring herself to the point of overcoming her own objections.\nAt last, however, when the meal was nearly over, she smiled at her little daughter, and said, \"All right, Dolly, you may go.\"\n\"Oh, mother!\" Dolly cried, overwhelmed with sudden delight. \"Really?\nOh, I am so glad! Are you sure you're willing?\"\n\"I've persuaded myself to be willing, against my will,\" returned Mrs. Fayre, whimsically. \"I confess I just hate to have you go, but I can't bear to deprive you of the pleasure trip. And, as you say, it would also keep Dotty at home, and so, altogether, I think I shall have to give in.\"\n\"Oh, you angel mother! You blessed lady! How good you are!\" And Dolly flew around the table and gave her mother a hug that nearly suffocated her.",
