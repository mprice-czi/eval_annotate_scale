Passage B is longer and uses mostly simple, high-frequency words, but its complexity is anchored by the single Tier 3 word 'capitol', a specific piece of world knowledge that might trip up some readers. This creates a compelling trade-off for an annotator: is the passage with generally more sophisticated vocabulary (A) more complex than the passage with one specific, potentially difficult noun (B)?

In contrast, Passage B uses more formal and abstract (Tier 2) vocabulary that requires a greater degree of lexical knowledge. Words like 'luxuriously', 'furnished', 'demanded', and 'presence' are less common and represent more complex concepts than the simple, tangible words in Passage A. While Passage B also has a more complex sentence structure, the difference in vocabulary is a primary and significant driver of the overall complexity gap. The decision is not immediately obvious because the words in B are not exceptionally rare, but a direct comparison reveals a clear step up in sophistication, making it a well-suited marginal pair.",
